# 🎁 GiftOnTime

**Delivering surprises exactly when the moment matters.**

GiftOnTime is a Django-based web application that solves a very real problem:  
when you order a gift online (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.), it often arrives **too early or too late**.  
GiftOnTime lets users schedule gifts to be delivered on a **specific date and time**, so special moments stay special.

## 🚀 The Idea

People plan surprises — birthdays, anniversaries, proposals — but logistics ruin the moment.

GiftOnTime acts as a **timed delivery layer**:
1. User pastes a product link (Amazon / Flipkart).
2. Selects delivery date & time.
3. We handle purchase, storage, and delivery at the right moment.

Simple for users. Powerful in impact.
